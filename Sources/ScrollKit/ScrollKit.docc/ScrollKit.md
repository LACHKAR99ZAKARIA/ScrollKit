# ``ScrollKit``

ScrollKit adds powerful scrolling features to `SwiftUI`.



## Overview

![Library logotype](Logo.png)

Some examples are scroll offset tracking and header views that stretch and transform as you pull down, and stick to the top when you scroll.

ScrollKit is designed to be easy to use, and basically just adds more properties to the standard SwiftUI `ScrollView`. It can be used on all Apple platforms, including iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS.



## Installation

ScrollKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
